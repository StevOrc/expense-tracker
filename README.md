Expense tracker is a small application where we track all transaction to understand the context consept in React.

We create a folder in src called 'context' in which we have 3 files :

    - GlobalState : global context for transactions
    - AppReducer : Global app reducer for transactions
    - ActionTypes : all actions for transactions (ADD, DELETE...)
